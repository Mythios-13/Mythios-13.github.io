Hey pal, Today i want to create a minecraft like game with you.
It will use html and three.js as codebase.
It's a minecraft like game, where you can add cubes to the scene.
We use the keys AWSD for move the character, space to jump and mouse to control camera.
when the player uses the left mouse trigger it adds a cube.
or the floor, make it a cube based floor, with a 64x64 cubes area, with 6 levels of deep. the upper level cubes are greenish, the other brown. add some pixel noise like texture to the cubes. 
I want it to add the cubes in the same grid as the other cubes,
they need to be aligned like the floor and ground.
I want the whole world editable. So the floor and underground act like the other added cubes, so I can also destroy them.
The cubes are stored in a efficient way, in a 3 dimentional chunk. The chunk if 64x64x128. The floor is layer 32,
 underneeth is the underground, keep the actual block types.
For initialisation, we should start with floor 32 the is filled with grass (like actual) and underneath till floor 16 dirt blocks.
For now, no blocks in level 1 to 15.
Add a collision detector, so if the player falls beneath floor 1, it's position is randomized in the chunk at level 33.
Also, when placing the cubes, we can place them on the other current cubes.
The floor and ground also are the cubes.
The the player uses the right mouse button, the cube that is in the ray cast is destroyed.
please use this file as inspiration : webXr/index.html , it's a webxr version of the game i would like to recreate in web alone.
create the new game in a file named index.html inside the folder MinecraftLike.
